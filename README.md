Embroidery Margin & Costs Calculator (2025)
This application is designed to help you calculate embroidery pricing for garments and caps based on input parameters such as garment cost, stitch count, handling fee, digitizing fee, and margin percentages. It also supports additional logos and calculates the final price per item with tiered quantity discounts.

What Does the App Do?
Allows you to toggle between Garment and Cap pricing modes.
Takes user inputs for:
Base item cost
Stitch count of the main logo
Handling fee for small orders
Digitizing fee for logo setup
Lets you specify margins and embroidery costs for defined quantity tiers.
Calculates the blank cost after applying margin, rounds it up to the nearest $0.25, and then adds embroidery and possible handling/digitizing fees.
Supports additional logos (e.g., sleeve, back-of-neck, opposite chest for garments; back/side (flag) and back text for caps) and factors their costs into the final per-item price.
For small orders (1-23), it applies the next tier's pricing plus handling and digitizing fees if toggled on.
Stitches over 8,000 add $0.75 per thousand stitches (rounded up).
Embroidery Pricing & Quantity Breaks

Quantity Tier	Embroidery Cost (up to 8,000 stitches)
24-47	$12.00
48-71	$11.00

For small orders (1-23), we use the 24-47 tier pricing plus handling and digitizing (if toggled).

Additional logos (sleeve, back-of-neck, opposite chest) use the same tier-based cost as the main logo.

For small orders (1-23 caps), we use the 24-71 tier pricing plus handling and digitizing (if toggled).

Small Orders
For both garments and caps, if the order is less than 24 items (i.e., 1-23), the app uses the next available tierâ€™s pricing plus a handling fee. Digitizing fees (for main and additional logos) are distributed per item as well.

Stitch Count Over 8,000
For stitch counts greater than 8,000, an extra $0.75 is added for each additional 1,000 stitches (rounded up).
