# Embroidery Margin & Costs Calculator (2025)

This application is designed to help you calculate embroidery pricing for garments and caps based on various parameters such as item cost, stitch count, handling fee, digitizing fee, and margins. It supports multiple tiers, additional logos, and applies specific rules for small orders and stitch counts.

## What Does the App Do?

- **Toggle Product Type:** Switch between **Garment** and **Cap** pricing modes.
- **User Inputs:** Enter base item cost, stitch count, handling fee, and digitizing fee.
- **Margins & Costs per Tier:** Define margin percentages and embroidery costs for different quantity tiers.
- **Additional Logos:** Add sleeve, back-of-neck, opposite chest (garment), or back/side (flag) and back text (cap) logos, each with their own cost structure.
- **Small Orders (<24):** For quantities 1-23, use the next available tier pricing plus handling and digitizing (if toggled on).
- **Stitch Count >8,000:** Adds $0.75 per thousand stitches (rounded up) beyond 8,000.
- **Rounding:** Blank cost rounds up to the nearest $0.25; no final rounding on the total price.
